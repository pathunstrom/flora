# Ideas

This is effectively a brainstorm document. Half ideas are allowed.

Breeding should take time, possibly days and/or weeks.

Conceit: All these plants are effectively 1 species. They will interbreed
freely.

Not all plants need be flowering

Social sharing?

Breeding should be intentional:
1. You should water intentionally
2. You should manually choose which plants to attempt cross breeding with

Limit the number of plants?

Bonsai element? Should trimming matter?

## Genetics:

* need to decide on features that can be bred
* maximum lifetime?
* "hardiness"
* color of plant
* color of flower
* number of flowers

How to encode the genetics?
