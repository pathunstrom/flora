# flora

A game about breeding strange flora.

## Inspiration

I like games that involve breeding with very little competition. Recently, I
became entranced with the flower breeding of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
I figure it'd be nice to have a game devoted to the plant breeding, but knew
it'd need to be slightly more complex than 3 genes with simple dominance trees.

Thus, flowers, became strange, perhaps alien, flora.

## How to approach this repository

This will explain the parts of the repo and why you might care.

### Design

The design directory is specifically for me to keep notes, half finished ideas,
and things like my GDD and design bible.
